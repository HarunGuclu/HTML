    <h2 style="background-color: black; color: aliceblue;">What is Cyber Security?</h2>
    <p>Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and
        data from malicious attacks. <br>
        It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. <br>
        The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few
        common categories.
    </p>
    <h4 style="color: aqua;"> <b>Network security</b> </h4>
    <p>
        <i>
            Network security is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers
            or opportunistic malware.
        </i>
    </p>
    <h4 style="font-size: larger;">

        Application security
    </h4>
    <p>
        <u>
            Application security focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. <br>

            A compromised application
            could provide access to the data its designed to protect. <br>
            Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed.

        </u>
    </p>
    <h4 style="font-size: xx-large;">Operational security</h4>
    <p>
        <mark>
            Operational security includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. <br>
            The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data may
            be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.

        Disaster recovery and business continuity
    </h4>
    <p style="color: #905;">
        <del>
            Disaster recovery and business continuity define how an organization responds to a cyber-security incident
            or
            any other event that causes the loss of operations or data. <br>
            Disaster recovery policies dictate how the organization restores its operations and information to return to
            the
            same operating capacity as before the event. <br>
            Business continuity is the plan the organization falls back on while trying to operate without certain
            resources.
